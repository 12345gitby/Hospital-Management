## Overview
The **Hospital Management System** is a comprehensive Java application designed to streamline and manage hospital operations. It provides features for handling patient records, doctor profiles, appointment scheduling, and billing. This system is built using Java for the core application and JDBC for database connectivity, with MySQL as the backend database.

## Features
- **Patient Management**: 
  - Add, update, delete, and view patient details.
- **Doctor Management**: 
  - Manage doctor information, including specializations and availability.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: 
  - Schedule, update, and cancel appointments between patients and doctors.
- **Billing System**: 
  - Generate and manage invoices for patient services.
- **User Authentication**: 
  - Secure login system for administrators and staff.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for database operations.
- **MySQL**: Database management system.
- **NetBeans/Eclipse**: IDEs used for development.

## Prerequisites
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit 8 or higher.
- **MySQL**: MySQL Server for database management.
- **MySQL Connector/J**: JDBC driver for MySQL.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-management-system.git
   cd hospital-management-system
   ```

2. **Setup the Database**:
   - Install and start MySQL Server.
   - Create a new database named `hospital_db`.
   - Import the provided SQL script to create necessary tables and insert sample data:
   ```sql
   source path/to/hospital_db.sql;
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Open `DBConnection.java`.
   - Update the following fields with your database credentials:
   ```java
   private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db";
   private static final String USER = "your_username";
   private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password";
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Compile and run the application using an IDE like NetBeans or Eclipse, or use the command line.

## Usage
1. **Login**: Enter the provided admin or staff credentials to access the system.
2. **Dashboard**: Navigate through different modules such as Patient Management, Doctor Management, Appointment Scheduling, and Billing.
3. **Operations**: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various records.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
